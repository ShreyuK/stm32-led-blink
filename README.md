# 🚀 NUCLEO-F401RE LED Blink Project

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates a basic LED blinking application for the **STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE** development board. The code toggles the onboard LED (LD2) connected to GPIO pin PA5 with a **500ms delay** between each state change.

## 🛠️ Development Environment
- **Hardware**: STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE
- **IDE Setup**: 
  - ⚙️ STM32CubeMX for peripheral configuration and code generation
  - ✏️ Visual Studio Code for code editing and building
  - ⚡ STM32CubeProgrammer for flashing the binary to the board

```

## 💻 Key Implementation
The main functionality is implemented in the main loop with just two lines of code:

```c
HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5); // Toggle LD2
HAL_Delay(500); // 500ms delay
```

## 🔧 Hardware Configuration
- 💡 LED LD2 is connected to GPIO pin PA5 (configured as output)
- ⏰ Default clock configuration generated by CubeMX

## 🚀 Build and Flash Instructions

### 🔨 Building the Project
You can build the project using either method:

1. **Command Line**:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

2. **VS Code**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` ⌨️
   - Select the **"Build"** task from the options

### ⚡ Flashing the Board
You can flash the compiled binary using either method:

1. **STM32CubeProgrammer GUI**:
   - Open STM32CubeProgrammer
   - Connect the NUCLEO board via USB
   - Load the generated binary file

2. **Command Line**:
   - Use STM32_Programmer_CLI with appropriate parameters

3. **VS Code** (if configured):
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` ⌨️
   - Select the **"Flash"** task from the options

## 📦 Dependencies
- STM32CubeF4 HAL drivers
- ARM GCC toolchain

## ✅ Expected Behavior
After flashing, the onboard green LED (LD2) should blink continuously with a period of **1 second** (500ms on, 500ms off). 🎯
